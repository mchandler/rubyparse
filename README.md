# Parsing Code Test

The purpose of this project is to show off my vast knowledge of Ruby
and how it can be used to parse text files. Prepare to be impressed.

## Installing This Code

+ Place telephone acoustic coupling on phone
+ Dial-in to the WOPR
+ Password is "Joshua" (no one will ever guess)
+ Initiate Global Thermonuclear War. It's just a game, no worries.

## Call For Help

I've had about two hours total to read up on Ruby, so this is not going
to be pretty. Be prepared to phone the authorities to report me for
egregious errors and a complete lack of skill.

## Running these scripts (for reals!)

On the command line:
+ ruby parser.rb

Enjoy!
